# Bowling Kata

Developed with Unreal Engine 4.27.2

## Description
You can play bowling in the floating bowling lane setup. Don't worry, you'll never fall of the platform - however the pins and the ball might fall off.
The game consist of 10 Frames, each with maximum 2 rolls (except the last Frame, when 3 rolls available). After each frame your calculated score will be shown.
After the very last roll, the game is over and your final score will be shown.

## Controls
`W,A,S,D` for movement, `space` for jump and `left mouse click` to release a ball. Recommended to release the ball while running - otherwise it will be a slow roll.
